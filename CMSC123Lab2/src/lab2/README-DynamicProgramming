Notes and Observations taken from using Dynamic Programming:
> DP is more suitable for getting a single, optimal answer rather than getting multiple paths (such as brute force)
> DP is very efficient when it looks for a single optimal path, but requires more space and becomes less efficient when searching for all possible minimal paths

Ratings:
1. Suitability for TSP (One Path) = highly suitable
2. Suitability for TSP (multiple paths) = uses lots of space and is hard to implement; unsuitable
3. Suitability for generating an answer = highly suitable
4. Concept comprehension = easy when you're trying to implement it for cases like the Fibonacci Sequence but not for TSP problems
